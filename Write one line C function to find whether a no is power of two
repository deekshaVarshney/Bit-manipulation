OUTPUT
30
No
!(x&(x-1))=0 (complement of a non zero value is a zero value)
//for a number which is not a power of two 
For example for x=3 (011) and x-1 =2(010)
x&(x-1)=011&010=010=2
hence it is a non zero number here 2 !(x&(x-1))=0

int main()
{
isPowerOfTwo(32)? printf("Yes\n"): printf("No\n");

return 0;
}


OUTPUT
0
Yes
//for a number which is power of two we get zero as the result of x&(x-1)
For example for 4 ( 100) and 16(10000), we get following after subtracting 1
3 –> 011
15 –> 01111
