Left Shift

x = x * 2^value (normal operation)

x << value (bit-wise operation)

x = x * 16 (which is the same as 2^4)

The left shift equivalent would be x = x << 4
Right Shift

x = x / 2^value (normal arithmetic operation)

x >> value (bit-wise operation)

x = x / 8 (which is the same as 2^3)

The right shift equivalent would be x = x >> 3
